## Introduction
This project is a smart vision-based quality testing system designed for the ecommerce industry. The system automates the inspection of products, ensuring both quality and quantity control using *high-resolution cameras, **image processing, and **deep learning*. It significantly reduces manual labor, improves accuracy, and offers real-time defect detection.

## Features
- *OCR (Optical Character Recognition)*: Extracts product information, brand, expiration date, and MRP from product labels.
- *Freshness Detection*: Analyzes visual cues to assess the freshness of perishable goods.
- *Quantity Detection*: Automatically counts products, ensuring that correct quantities are packed and shipped.

## Technology Stack
- *Frontend*: 
  - React.js
  - CSS
- *Backend*:
  - Node.js
  - Python Flask
- *Deep Learning*:
  - TensorFlow for CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
  - Tesseract.js for OCR
  - Pytorch
  - Keras
  - OpenCV
  - easyOCR
- *Hardware*:
  - High-resolution cameras for image capture
